EXHIBIT A — ETHICAL USE GUIDELINES
Palimpsest-MPL License Version 1.0
================================================================================

1. PURPOSE

   These guidelines define ethical use expectations for software distributed
   under the Palimpsest-MPL License. They are not legally binding restrictions
   but represent the community's shared values and expectations.

2. PRINCIPLES

   2.1. Respect for Emotional Lineage
        Users and distributors should acknowledge and preserve the cultural,
        narrative, and symbolic meaning embedded in Covered Software. This
        includes protest traditions, cultural heritage, trauma narratives,
        and community stories where documented.

   2.2. Transparency in Automated Processing
        When Covered Software is processed by Non-Interpretive Systems
        (AI training, content aggregation, automated summarization), such
        use should be documented publicly and not misrepresent the
        provenance of outputs.

   2.3. Good Faith Attribution
        Contributors should be credited accurately. Derivative works should
        maintain the attribution chain and not obscure the origins of
        contributions.

   2.4. Community Benefit
        Commercial use of Covered Software should contribute to the broader
        community through bug fixes, documentation, or other improvements
        where feasible.

3. SPECIFIC GUIDANCE

   3.1. AI and Machine Learning
        - Training on Covered Software requires disclosure
        - Generated outputs must not claim Emotional Lineage of the original
        - Model cards should reference source materials

   3.2. Content Aggregation
        - Aggregators must link back to original sources
        - Context must not be stripped in ways that distort meaning
        - Cultural and narrative context should be preserved

   3.3. Commercial Products
        - Products built on Covered Software should acknowledge it
        - Pricing should not exploit communities that created the work
        - Support and improvements should flow back to the community

4. ENFORCEMENT

   These guidelines are enforced through community norms, not legal action.
   Disputes should be raised with the Palimpsest Stewardship Council for
   non-binding guidance.

5. AMENDMENTS

   These guidelines may be updated by the Palimpsest Stewardship Council.
   Updates apply to new distributions, not retroactively.
