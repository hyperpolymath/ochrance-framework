# 1. Adopt Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR) Template

Date: 2026-02-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Managing multiple repositories with an ad-hoc approach led to significant
inconsistencies across the ecosystem. Common problems included:

- Missing or incomplete configuration files (SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md,
  .editorconfig, etc.)
- State files (STATE.a2ml, META.a2ml, ECOSYSTEM.a2ml) placed in the repository
  root instead of the canonical `.machine_readable/` directory
- Duplicate or conflicting workflow definitions across repos
- No standardized entry point for AI agents interacting with repositories
- Inconsistent bot directive configurations leading to unreliable automation
- No contractile enforcement or Justfile automation

Without a single source of truth for repository structure, each new repo
required manual setup and inevitably drifted from best practices over time.

## Decision

Adopt the Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR) template (`rsr-template-repo`) as
the canonical starting point for all new repositories. Existing repositories
will migrate incrementally as they receive active development.

The RSR template provides:

- **Machine-readable state files** in `.machine_readable/` (STATE.a2ml,
  ECOSYSTEM.a2ml, META.a2ml, AGENTIC.a2ml, NEUROSYM.a2ml, PLAYBOOK.a2ml)
- **AI manifest** (`0-AI-MANIFEST.a2ml`) as a universal entry point for all
  AI agents
- **Bot directives** in `.machine_readable/bot_directives/` for bot orchestration integration
- **Contractiles** in `.machine_readable/contractiles/` (k9, dust, lust, must, trust) for
  policy enforcement
- **Standardized workflows** (16+ GitHub Actions workflows, all SHA-pinned)
- **Justfile automation** with standard recipes for common tasks
- **Security and governance files**: SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md,
  CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, LICENSE (PMPL-1.0-or-later)
- **Architecture Decision Records** in `docs/decisions/`

New repositories are created by cloning the template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{{OWNER}}/rsr-template-repo new-repo-name
cd new-repo-name
rm -rf .git && git init
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- Consistency across all repositories, enforced from creation
- Automated compliance checking via `rsr-antipattern.yml` workflow
- Bot fleet can operate reliably across all repos with predictable structure
- AI agents (Claude, Gemini, etc.) have a standardized entry point via
  `0-AI-MANIFEST.a2ml`
- New contributors can onboard faster with familiar, documented structure
- Reduced maintenance burden: fix once in template, propagate to all repos
- Machine-readable state enables tooling and automation pipelines

### Negative

- Migration effort for existing repos requires time and attention
- Learning curve for contributors unfamiliar with RSR conventions
- Template updates need propagation mechanism to existing repos
- Some repos may have unique needs that do not fit the standard template
  without customization

### Neutral

- Existing CI/CD pipelines continue to work; RSR workflows are additive
- Third-party dependencies retain their original licenses regardless of
  repo structure
- ADR process itself is part of the template, enabling future decisions
  to be recorded consistently
